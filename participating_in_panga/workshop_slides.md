Speaking notes [example - adapt for presenter personality]

[acknowledgement of country] 

Thank you all for being here today - hopefully you've picked up a bit of the context for why we're here today from Yam Daisy. 

So I'd like to beign with a circle around the room so everyone has a chance to introduce themselves and settle into the space a bit.

There will be more oppourtinties to talk with each other later, for now please just share:  
- names / pronouns / and what land you're arriving from.
- And, complete the sentence "One characteristic of my vision of a better future is...."

Example: 
- Hi, I'm Teq, I live locally on Wurundjuri county, and I'm they for pronouns. "One characteristic of my vision of a better future is... a greater appreciation for the time and energy it takes to build networks of nourishing interdependent relationships".

[ACTIVITY]

Thank you all for sharing. Now I'd like to run through what you can expect for our time together today.

##  Workshop Aims 

* Building connections around our interest in collective approaches to meeting our basic needs   

* Sharing the concepts we are building upon within *Panga*   
  
* Inviting ongoing conversations and collaborations that build on shared conceptual contexts  


<!-- 
Speaking notes...

* So our reasons for preparing this workshop were threefold: 
  1. Our main goal is to invite ongoing conversations and collaborations that can build upon a shared context    
  2. We aim to provide this shared context by sharing some of the key concepts that we hope to build upon with Panga 
  3. We also hope that this workshop opens up more oppourtunities for you each to connect with others who are intersted in experimenting with collectivising one or more of their basic needs.

In terms of structure, we'll begin with a presentation to introducing this thing we're calling Panga, outline the values and theories of change that we've identified as motiviating our participation in Panga so far, and summarising some of the key concepts that we're hoping to build on in the future.

Along the way we'll ask you to participate in a few thought-experiment type activities in small groups. Then, after we've finished the presentation and main activities, we'll open up space for further less-structured discussions.

## *Panga* 

> Supporting experimental approaches to collectively meeting our basic needs of food, shelter, care, safety, energy, and transport"


<!-- 
Speaking notes....

So, this thing we're calling Panga emerged within the context of Jade and/or I having had conversations with many of you, as well as others in our various networks around various approaches to collaborative housing, food cooperatives, and collective approaches to care. 

At some point in 2023 e deciding to collaborate on finding ways to connect these conversations and support the various initatives as they emerge. 

We'll go into more details later, but for now it is enough to know that the goal we've decided to focus on is "supporting experimental approaches to collectively meeting our basic needs of food, shelter, care, saftey, energy, and transport".

Before we get to the details of *how* and *why* we aim to support these experiments, it is important to draw attention to the specific values and dense concepts this goal draws upon.

Speaking notes: 
Inevitably, there will also be some values and concepts we're treating as either as background context and/or potential tangents  

So if we use any unfamilar terms let us know. We'll do our best to clarify background concepts on the fly and suggest some resources that provide more detail on the potential tangents.  

For example, while the 'Overton Window' and 'Commons' are a background concepts we might reference in passing and can clarify if needed, explaining our choice of the term 'Panga' for this project could lead to tangents... 
  (Tangent: our use of the term was chosen based on it's use for the world described in the 'Monk and Robot' series of speculative fiction books written by Becky Chambers. Panga is, of course, a polysemous word - even in English it's multiple meanings include a specific type of fish, type of boat, and a type of knife.... )

## Values 
Grounded  
Interdependent 
Prefigurative
Pluralistic

## Theories of Change
Resilience through collectivism
Think globally, act locally
Prefiguring better futures 

<!-- 
Speaking notes....

The values we hope to embody through Panga's approach to cultivating more collective practices are: 
 
  * Grounded
  * Interdependent
  * Prefiguritive 
  * Pluralistic

The best way to describe these values is to highlight how they reflect our theories of change, so I'll go through each of these in more detail. 

For this, it may help to know that a theory of change statement typically has the structure 
'If we do this TACTIC then we can achive this STRATEGIC GOAL because of these REASONS (or, by this MECHANISM)'

In Panga, we are focusing on the tactic of 'experimenting with supporting multiple approaches to collectively meeting basic needs within our local areas'. 

We think that this tactic contributes towards three goals: 
* Resiliance through collectivism
* Thinking globally while acting locally 
* Prefiguring better futures

# If we experiment with collectively meeting the basic needs within our local areas, we can...

build local resilience by cultivating opportunities to practice relational skills that will help us collectively govern common resources when needed

##  Resilience through collectivism

# Reflecting the values we place in... 
remaining **grounded** in our local contexts while rparticipating in **prefigurative** practices that contribute to better futures by cultivating **interdependent** relationships

<!-- 
Speaking notes....

In the coming years and decades, local resilience will have real, on-the-ground benefits to people’s lives as we deal with the increasing effects of climate change.

We believe that experimenting with multiple pluralistic collectives to manage basic resources can contribute to greater local resilience by providing oppourtinities to practice the relational skills that will help  us collectively govern common resources when climate-change disrupts the current supplies of basic needs (such as food, energy, and shelter) via private and/or public systems.

Our interest in this theory of change reflects the value we place on remaining **grounded** in our local contexts, while participating in **prefigurative** practices that contribute to better futures by * cultivating resilience skills such as the web of **interdependent** trust-based relationships that have been repeatedly shown to underpin the sustainability of collective practices

<!-- 
Speaking notes....

With Panga we are concentrating on our local areas. The idea is that supporting an increase in the number of experimental ways of living more collectively in a particular area will have a noticeable impact on the Overton Window by modelling alternatives to the status quo and amplifying, and being amplified by, collective practices across the globe 

These beliefs reflects our appreciation that the local and global are **interdependent** and our value for remaining **grounded** by our ability to impact our local conditions,  while cultivating a **pluralistic** appreciation for alternative strategies emerging within different conditions

# [Prefigurative Politics in Practice](https://commonslibrary.org/prefigurative-politics-in-practice/)



<!-- 
Speaking notes....

 In Panga we focus on experiments in various forms of *collective practices* we hope will help to 'prefigure' better futures.

As a theory of change, the idea is that if we experiment with collectively meeting the basic needs within our local areas, we can  explore multiple here-and-now implementations of our desired potential futures by supporting each other to explore multiple approaches to collective governance of shared resources

This idea draws on the concept of 'Prefigurative Politics' for actions that contribute to political change through ‘the deliberate experimental implementation of desired future social relations and practices in the here-and-now’. 

While the term 'prefigurative politics' emerged from a particular sets of activist and academic contexts, I wrote an article for the Commons Library outlining how this concept has long been an important features of grassroots organising.

This theory of change reflects our value in cultivating **pluralistic** visions of what potential better futures could be, and the value we place on the potential for **prefigurative** practices to contribute, along with other forms of activism, to us collectively reaching towards ever better yet-to-be-determined futures.

For today, the important point is that prefigurative politics play an important role in change-making practices that can support other forms of activism - including efforts that focus on resisting and/or reforming existing systems - by planting the seeds of multiple alternatives we may want to build on in the future.

## Collectivising basic needs grounded in place
* Collectivising: moving towards more collective governance of the production and distribution of common resources 

* Grounded in place: variations in local conditions may impact collective governace of relevant common resources 

* Basic needs: regularly occuring needs we expect to meet in our shared location 
### *Food, Shelter, Care, Safety, Energy & Transport*

<!-- 
Speaking notes....

While we might conceptualise 'basic needs' in other ways, we've chosen to focus on six needs we consider 'basic' based on three considerations: 

1. We could potentially more towards more collective governance of the production and distribution of relevant resources required to meet this neeed without breaking any local laws

2. For most people in our location, the need likely repeats regularly and it is ther responsibiltiy of each adult to meet that need (and those of any dependents) 

3. Potential variations in local conditions could potentially impact the desisions made about the production and distribution of relevant resources  

Question prep note: we considered 'livelihood' as a basic need but narrowed our focus given that the Enspiral network already provides support for those looking to meet thier 'livelihood' in ways that contribute to our collective well-being.

## Brainstorming examples of experiments in collective practice that might...

* Reduce reliance on profit-driven providers of food and energy

* Reduce reliance on centralised saftey services 

* Move towards collective care responsibilities

* Move towards collective stewardship of housing as shelter while returning land-governance to Indigenous custodians

<!-- 
Facilitation notes....

ACTIVITY: Organise participants into four groups, and ask them to brainstom potential experiments for assigned goals (e.g., for each group assign one 'reduce' goal and one 'move towards' goal to provide examples experiments for): 

* Moving away from profit-driven providers of food and energy and towards collectively governed production and distribution 

* Moving away from relying on centralised saftey services  and towards collectively preparing strateries for surviving external emergancies and internal conflicts together 

* Moving away from individualised expectations of self-care and towards collective care responsibilities

* Moving away from accuring equity in property towards collective stewardship of housing as shelter and returning land to Indigenous governance

## Pluralist approaches to collectively meeting our basic needs 


<!-- 
Speaking notes....

* Pluralism: 
  * We aim to support experiments in a wide range of different approaches to collectiving basic needs. 
  * We don't expect that there is any single 'right' way to collectively governing resources that will be appropriate for all local contexts.

## Panga  

> Supporting experimental approaches to collectively meeting our basic needs of shelter, food, energy, transport, and care

<!-- 
Speaking notes....

As mentioned earlier, Panga is a project that aims to support experimental approaches to collectively meeting our basic needs. 

While it begain from discussions about how to meet our collective housing and food need, we started thinking about the shared challanges faced by people trying to collectively govern shared resources across needs beyond housing and food. 

To build on that notion we decided to collaborate on developing some infastructure to support a range of different concrete efforts to collective an increasing list of potential basic needs.

We slowly narrowed in on what we think is a feasbile goal for a project with zero funds and, as yet, only two of us involed. 

There are multiple directions we could take the project from here, depending on how our vision for Panga develops as more collaborators get involved. 

* So far, we have focused on amplifying and developing conceptual and technical tools that could reduce the barriers to forming and participating in small self-governing groups able to experiment with different approaches to collectivising basic needs.

* For example, today we are offer some concepts that we hope will provide  shared context for further conversations as part of an early-stage of conceptual tool development. 

* An example of technical tools is the *Panga Campfire* that has the potential to support people to connect with others interested in participating in experimental approaches to collectivising basic needs.

* We're using 'conversations' loosly here. While some may choose to engage in conversations and connect with potential collaborates for upcomming local experiements in collectivisng basic needs, the intention is to provide a space to read and share examples of how people are experimenting in collectivising basic needs.

## Invitation principles

<!-- 
Speaking notes....

While we are fortunate to participate in multiple broader networks through which we connected with most of you, we recognise the privilages that allow us to have the capacity to participate in multiple networks.

Panga is intended to complement the continued flourishing of such networks, by focusing on supporting small self-governing groups to participate in multiple *place-based* experiments in collectively meeting our *basic needs*. 

For those intereted, we are therefore hoping to co-create additional opportinties to connect with each other about our various approaches to experimenting with collectivising one or more of their basic needs (without joiniing yet-another-network).

As collectivist experiments have highlighted there is value of cultivating informal networks large enough to support multiple self-governing groups yet small enough that everyone is connected to everyone else, either directly or via someone they trust

With this in mind, once someone is involved in Panga they can support new people to participate with them by following a transparent invitation process and taking reponsibility for supporting the new person navigate the space.
