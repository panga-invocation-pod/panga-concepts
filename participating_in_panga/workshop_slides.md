## *Panga* 

Supporting experimental approaches to collectively meeting our daily needs of shelter, food, transport, care, and connection.


### 

> "We want something better than the individualist isolation, brutal unfairness and impending ecological collapse of late-stage capitalism, and we don’t  want to wait for top-down change to provide it for us.

###
> Sprouting from the cracks in late stage capitalism, Panga supports explorations of potential better futures - trying them out now to build better lives for ourselves, and helping develop models useful to others. It’s not a singular utopia, it’s a way of collaborating just enough to support multiple autonomous experiments and to connect with all the great projects that already exist."

##  Workshop Aims 

  * Clarify the values and key concepts that we hope to build upon with Panga 
  * Invite ongoing conversations and collaborations that build on this shared context  
  * Support people to connect with others interested in experimenting with collectivising one or more of their basic needs.
