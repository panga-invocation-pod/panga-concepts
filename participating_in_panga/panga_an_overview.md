# What is Panga?

Panga is a project to support experimental approaches to housing that collectively meet our daily needs of food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety.

We want something better than the individualist isolation, brutal unfairness and impending ecological collapse of late-stage capitalism, and we don’t want to wait for top-down change to provide it for us.

Sprouting from the cracks in late stage capitalism, Panga supports explorations of potential better futures - trying them out now to build better lives for ourselves, and helping develop models useful to others. It’s not a singular utopia, it’s a way of collaborating just enough to support multiple autonomous experiments and to connect with all the great projects that already exist.

This iteration of Panga emerged from an Invocation Pod -- an exploration of the possiblity that we might invoke a network of people practicing various configurations of experimental approaches to collectivising basic needs. Building on this, we began collaborating on amplifying and developing technical and conceptual tools that reduce the barriers to these collective practices. In inviting more people to co-create a Panga network with us, we are seeking more collaboraters who are willing to join us in taking responsibility for creating and maintaining the supportive and respectful culture we are hoping to cultivate twithin and through Panga processes. 

As part of this process, we have created a [Panga Context-Setting Workshop](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_workshop_intro.md) to outline the current set of foundational [values](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_values.md), concepts, and practices that we hope the Panga network will build upon.    

With this shared foundation, we hope to develop various Panga processes and tools that will help us all to self-organise into multiple overlapping small-groups who can practice collectivisng basic needs such as food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety. 

Additionally, for those who choose to become collaborators in future iterations of the Panga vision, there are multiple avenues for participation, including;

  * Recharging with cozy hopepunk conversations at the [Panga Campfire](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_campfire.md) and amplifying global examples of collective practices that we can learn from in our local contexts.
  * Nourishing our interdependent relationships (e.g., by attending and hosting [Panga Gatherings](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_gatherings.md))
  * Exploring the potential of specific collectivist experiments (e.g. by participating in the [Panga Pods](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_pods.md) experiments) 
  * Adapting Panga-hosted tools and processes to experiment with longer-term collectivist practices (see [Panga Collectives](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_collectives.md))
  * Stewarding the Panga vision and/or building the infrastructure to support this vision (see [Panga Collectives](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_collectives.md))
  * Inviting potential-participants into the Panga network - see [Invitation Principles](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_invitation_principles.md) for the process through which hope anyone in Panga can support new people to participate in the Panga network. 
  * [Hosting a Panga Context-Setting Workshop](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/workshop_host_guidelines.md) to support recently invited participants join us in co-creating Panga
