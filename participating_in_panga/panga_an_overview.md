# What is Panga?

Panga is a project to support experimental approaches to housing that collectively meet our daily needs of food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety.

We want something better than the individualist isolation, brutal unfairness and impending ecological collapse of late-stage capitalism, and we don’t want to wait for top-down change to provide it for us.

Sprouting from the cracks in late stage capitalism, Panga supports explorations of potential better futures - trying them out now to build better lives for ourselves, and helping develop models useful to others. It’s not a singular utopia, it’s a way of collaborating just enough to support multiple autonomous experiments and to connect with all the great projects that already exist.

The initial iteration of Panga emerged from an Invocation Pod -- a collaboration focused on invoking a network to support participation in various configurations of experimental approaches to collectivising basic needs. The main approach to this process focused on amplifying and developing technical and conceptual tools that reduce the barriers to collective practices. 

As part of this process, we created a pathway for inviting participats into the Panga network. From there, the goal is for Panga participants to self-organise - with the aid of the Panga tools - to practice collectivisng basic needs such as food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety. 

Following our [Invitation Principles](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_invitation_principles.md), our current process for supporting people to join this network is to provide an oppourtintiy for potential-participants to attend a [Panga Context-Setting Workshop](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_workshop_intro.md). This workshop aims to provide a shared set of foundational concepts (such as our [values](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_values.md). For those who choose to become collaborators in future iterations of the Panga vision, there are multiple avenues for participation, including;

  * Recharging with cozy hopepunk conversations at the [Panga Campfire](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_campfire.md) and amplifying global examples of collective practices that we can learn from in our local contexts.
  * Nourishing our interdependent relationships (e.g., by attending and hosting [Panga Gatherings](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_gatherings.md))
  * Exploring the potential of specific collectivist experiments (e.g. by participating in the [Panga Pods](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_pods.md) experiments) 
  * Adapting Panga-hosted tools and processes to experiment with longer-term collectivist practices (see [Panga Collectives](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_collectives.md))
  * Stewarding the Panga vision and/or building the infrastructure to support this vision (see Panga Collectives)
  * [Hosting a Panga Context-Setting Workshop](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/workshop_host_guidelines.md) to support recently invited participants join us in co-creating Panga
