# What are Panga Pods? 

One way to explore the possibilities emerging within Panga is to form or join a 'Pod' to build relationships across the network, to experience mutual support and care, and to explore potential pathways for building resilience through collectivising our basic needs of shelter, food, transport, care, and connection.

## How to form a Pod

If you are interested in forming a Panga Pod of a particular type, we encourage you to take the role of the 'caller' and express an initial invitation on [Panga chat] to coordinates a group of between 3 and 5 people to co-create a shared experience based on the intentions, principles, and format chosen by those involved. Drawing on the well-established patterns of forming 'Pods' articulated by Enspiral:

    The intention clearly states the common intent bringing a group together (e.g. collectivising transport needs, collaborative approaches to housing, creating resilient mutual support practices, coordinating emergency preparedness, etc.,).
    Principles are a set protocols and values that guide the culture of the pod. (e.g., you might consider principles around context, meeting rhythm, as well as facilitation and hosting duties).
    Rituals are practices that help us interact in ways that align with our principles (examples, include 'opening' and 'closing' rituals to help create a container for more intentional ways of relating during meeting/gathering).
    A format gives your pod a direction and structure over time. It might specify the number of sessions (e.g. 5 sessions), a set of rituals for each session, or perhaps even activities that participants do in-between calls.

## Types of Pods

Pods can emerge from many different combinations of intentions, principles, rituals and formats. 

Exploratory Pods: these Pods are typically formed for a fixed time-frame (e.g., five sessions over eight weeks) with the intention of exploring a specific aspect of potential collective practice. A non-exhaustive set of examples of such Pods include:
  * Transport Pods: pods focused on the transport aspects of our basic need. For example, a pod formed with the intention of exploring barriers to collectivising transport.
  * Shelter Pods: pods focused on the shelter aspects of our basic needs. For example, a pod formed with the intention of exploring pathways towards collectivising shelter
  * Food Pods: pods focused on the food aspects of our basic needs. For example, a pod formed with the intention of creating ways to collectivise food across (a specific set of) multiple houses
  * Care Pods: pods focused on the care aspects of our basic needs. For example, a pod formed with the intention of providing a supportive space for reflection and growth around asking for, and offering care.
  * Support Pods: pods focused on the relational safety aspects of our basic needs. For example, a pod formed with the intention of exploring if/how we might better collectivise how we each meet our ongoing material and emotional support needs.
  * Emergency Preparedness Pods: pods focused on the environmental safety aspects of our basic needs. For example, a pod formed with the intention of supporting each other in preparing for specific types of emergencies (fire, flood, etc.,).
  * Connection Pods: pods focused on the connection aspects of our basic needs. For example, a pod formed to explore different approaches to building intentional relationships as a foundation for more collectivist approaches to meeting our basic needs.

While most Pods will form and disperse after one cycle of podding, some may choose to continue beyond the initial format. Examples include:  
  * Exploratory Pod, cycle 2: when those in an exploratory pod make an explicit agreement to continue for another 'round' of active podding in the same format as the initial round. 
  * Collaboration Pods: a goal-focused collaboration that focus on implementing a specific 'next step' in collectivising a specific set of basic needs.
  * Latent Pods: these pods are intended to persist over long time period of time with minimal process other than when a participant re-calls the group for short bursts of active podding 'as needed'. A non-exhaustive set of examples of Pods that might take this format include:
    Emergency Support Pods: formed by a caller who asks specific people to join who they would then call on for material and/or relational support during moments of crises and/or other personal emergency situations.
    Personal Accountability Pods: formed by a caller explicitly asking specific people (ideally, different people to those in their Support Pod) if they can call on them for support in taking accountability for contributing to violence, harm or, abuse (as soon after becoming aware of their role in the situation as possible). Different from most other pods, each person is encouraged to form their own Accountability Pod.
    Personal Support Pods: formed by a caller explicitly asking specific people (ideally, different people to those in their Accountability Pod) if they can call on them for support after experiencing of witnessing violence, harm, or abuse.

 
## Example Panga Pods include:

    Panga Invocation Pod, cycle 1 (May-Dec 2023) - formed with the intention of exploring how to articulate a *something* that could support multi-house collective practices as a starting point to build upon with others
    Panga Invocation Pod, cycle 2 (Jan 2024 - June 2024) - building on the articulated intentions, this was more of a 'collaboration pod' the focused on the goal of creating an invitation pathway for others to participate in co-creating the Panga network.
