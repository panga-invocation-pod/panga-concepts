# Panga Values

The values we hope to embody through Panga are: 

  * Collectivist futures
  * Pluralistic experimentation
  * Prefigurative politics 
  * Grounded practice
  * Interdependent relationships

These values reflect our theories of change: 

  * Resilience through Collectivism: we believe that multiple pluralistic collectives managing those local resources that relate to real life needs (shelter, food, transport, energy, etc) can lead to greater local resilience. In the coming years and decades, local resilience will have real, on-the-ground benefits to people’s lives as we deal with the increasing effects of climate change.

  * Prefigurative Politics: while the term may not be widely used outside of certain activist circles, prefigurative politics is fundamental to the goals of Panga. Briefly, the idea is that we focus on political change through ‘the deliberate experimental implementation of desired future social relations and practices in the here-and-now’ (Boggs, 1977). The Commons Library article [Prefigurative Politics in Practice](https://commonslibrary.org/prefigurative-politics-in-practice/) outlines how prefigurative politics fosters plurality and offers an important grounded change-making practices that can support other forms of activism such as efforts that focus on resisting and/or reforming existing systems.

  * Think globally, act locally: Panga concentrates on a particular local area. The idea is that supporting an increase in the number of experimental ways of living more collectively in a particular area will have a noticeable impact on the Overton Window locally. We believe that the broader ripple effects of the local acts will amplify, and be amplified by, complementary local practices across the globe.
