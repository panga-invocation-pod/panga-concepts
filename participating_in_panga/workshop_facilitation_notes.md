### Context & Aims 
* Context 
   * At this stage, Panga is a project exploring ways to support small self-governing groups who are experimenting with multiple approaches to collectivising basic needs within our local areas (needs such as food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety). 
   * This project is something that [] and I have been slowly collaborating on since early 2023 ....  

* Aims:
  * By sharing our progress so far, we have three main aims:
    * To clarify the values and key concepts that we hope to build upon with Panga, and how these inform our approach to amplifying and developing tools to support small self-governing groups experiment with multiple approaches to collectivising basic needs. 
    * To invite ongoing conversations that build on this shared 'Panga vision' context and connect people across our various networks who are interested in experimenting with collectivising one or more of their basic needs
