## Context & Aims 
* Building on conversations with many of you (and others in our various networks), Jade and I have been working on a project that we've been calling 'Panga'. 

* We will share more concrete details later, but for now, Panga can be described as a project to support experimental approaches to collectively meeting our basic needs. For example: 
  * One aspect of this is our goal of amplifying and developing tools to support small self-governing groups to experiment with different approaches to collectivising basic needs.
  * Another aspect is our goal of cultivating ways for people from across our various networks to connect with others interested in experimenting with collectivising one or more of their basic needs.

* It's this second aspect of our Panga goals we want to focus on today.

* Before we dive into the details, it's important to note that our approach reflects specific values and draws on multiple dense concepts. 

* One of our main aims today is to outline these more detail so that we have a shared context from which to explore further possibilities together. 

* However, there are also some concepts we're treating as backgrond context 

* So if we use any terms without connecting them with a familiar concept, let us know. We'll do our best to clarify on the fly and/or suggest some resources that provide more detailed context. 

* For example, while the 'Overton Window' and 'Commons' are a background concepts we might reference in passing, and can clarify if needed, explaining our choice of the term 'Panga' for this project could lead to tangents... 
   
## Values   
The values we hope to embody through Panga's approach to cultivating more collective practices are: 

  * Pluralistic 
  * Grounded
  * Interdependent

These values reflect our theories of change: 

  * In the coming years and decades, local resilience will have real, on-the-ground benefits to people’s lives as we deal with the increasing effects of climate change. We believe that experimenting with multiple pluralistic collectives to manage basic resources can contribute to greater local resilience by providing opportunities to practice the relational skills that will help us adapt to climate-change driven disruptions to the current supply of basic needs (such as food, energy, and shelter) via private and/or public systems. Our interest in this theory of change reflects the value we place in remaining **grounded** in our local contexts, while participating in **prefigurative** practices that contribute to better futures by cultivating resilience skills such as the web of **interdependent** trust-based relationships that have been repeatedly shown to underpin the sustainability of collective practices 


  * Think globally, act locally: with Panga we are concentrating on our local areas. The idea is that supporting an increase in the number of experimental ways of living more collectively in a particular area will have a noticeable impact on the Overton Window by modelling alternatives to the status quo and amplifying, and being amplified by, collective practices across the globe  These beliefs reflects our appreciation that the local and global are **interdependent** and our value for remaining **grounded** by our ability to impact our local conditions,  while cultivating a **pluralistic** appreciation for alternative strategies emerging within different conditions 


  * Prefiguring Better Futures: if we experiment with collectively meeting the basic needs within our local areas, we can  explore multiple here-and-now implementations of our desired potential futures by supporting each other to explore diverse approaches to collectively governing common resources. This notion draws on the concept of 'Prefigurative Politics' - actions that contribute to political change through ‘the deliberate experimental implementation of desired future social relations and practices in the here-and-now’ (Boggs, 1977). While the term 'prefigurative politics' emerged from a particular set of activist and academic contexts, the Commons Library article [Prefigurative Politics in Practice](https://commonslibrary.org/prefigurative-politics-in-practice/) outlines how this concept has long been an important features of grassroots organising. This theory of change reflects our value in cultivating **pluralistic** visions of what potential better futures could be, and the value we place on the potential for **prefigurative** practices to contribute, along with other forms of activism, to us collectively reaching towards ever better yet-to-be-determined better futures.
