# What are Panga Gatherings? 

In the context of Panga, Gatherings include a range of in-person and virtual formats of coming together to cultivate the relationships through which we might better collectivise our basic needs. Examples, include:

* 'Gathering' around a digital 'camp fire' for asynchronous conversations exploring potential pathways for collectivising our basic needs of shelter, food, transport, care, and connection.
* Potluck gatherings for building relationships within Panga that can support concrete collectivist practices
* Retreat Gatherings to come together, re-connect, and co-create the next steps of Panga
