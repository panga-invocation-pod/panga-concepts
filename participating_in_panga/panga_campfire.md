# Panga Campfire

We would like to invite you to join us in reclaiming time to rest, recharge, and indulge in cosy hopepunk conversations about building better futures by collectivising our basic needs. 

## Why a Campfire?

Collectivist experiments have highlighted the value of cultivating decentralised networks large enough to support multiple self-governing groups yet small enough that everyone is connected to everyone else, either directly or via someone they trust.

Complementing the continued flourishing of existing networks, Panga is a project seeking to combine networked relationships with small-group self-governance to cultivate multiple place-based experiments in collectively meeting our daily needs. As part of this vision, we are invoking a metaphorical Campfire to gather around and immerse in hopepunk conversations about potential better futures.

Offering an asynchronous dose of hope, this Campfire is intended to help us recharge so that we can better sustain our efforts at engaging in our broader communities, weaving our networked connections, and experimenting with different forms of collectivist practices within small self-governing groups.

Along the way, we hope that the conversations that emerge around this Campfire can contribute to shaping the emerging direction of Panga - including the various ways we might experiment with how we support each other to meet our basic needs in ways that contribute to potential better futures for all.

## How do I find the Campfire?

The following offers some directions on how to find us. We are intentionally a little off the beaten path technologically, so please reach out if you're having difficulty. 

TBC.

## Can I invite new people to participate?

We are seeking collaborates who are willing to join us in taking responsibility for creating and maintaining the supportive and respectful culture we are hoping to cultivate through our Campfire conversations.

With this in mind, invitations to join these conversaations tend to follow from participation in the Context-Setting Workshop. For more guidence on when/how to invite new participants, please see the [Panga Invitation Principles](participating_in_panga/invitation_principles.md)
