# What are Collectives?

In the context of Panga, a collective can be understood as small group of people who collectively make decisions towards agreed-upon goals. 

## Panga Collectives

These are the collectives that emerge during Panga Planning and/or contribute to Panga ecosystem efforts to support experimental approaches to collectively meeting our daily needs of shelter, food, transport, care, and connection.

Current and Emerging Collectives:

    Redbug Collective - focusing on developing software tools
    Mosscap Collective - focusing on developing and curating conceptual tools

Proposed Panga Collectives:

    Panga Stewardship Collective: focused on developing and implementing governance practices (including periodically revisiting purpose, scope, value-principles alignment calibrations, and processes).
    Panga Gatherings Collective: focused on designing, hosting (and supporting others to host) Panga gatherings
    Interface-with-Capitalism Collective: a collective focused on developing process for navigating the financial and legal features required for various Panga-associated collectives to exist within the current systems.

Examples of Potential Collectives for Experimenting with the Panga vision (and/or potential Panga-associated Collectives):

    Brassica multi-house food & transport collective
    Pluto multi-house shelter collective
    Nibs multi-house shelter & care collective

Additional Collectives can be proposed by Panga participants

## Panga-associated Collecctives 

Reflecting the pluralist value of Panga, we also encourage participants seeking to practice broader froms of collective practice where the focus is on additional goals (that don't focus on collectiving basic needs) and/or are otherwise positioned outside of the Panga contexts. When these collectives align with the Panga vision and may draw upon and/or contribute to the Panga ecosystem, 
they may choose to be positioned as 'Panga-associated' collectives. Examples include:
