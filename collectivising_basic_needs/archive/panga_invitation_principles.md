# Panga Invitation Principles
 
## Invitation Context  
Panga aims to connect people who are experimenting with various approaches to collectively meeting daily needs such as food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety in our local areas.

We want these connections to grow at the speed of trust; to remain open to new participants while still functioning as a supportive space to gather and explore different approaches to collectivising basic needs. 

In inviting participants into this emerging network, we are seeking collaborators who are willing to join us in taking responsibility for creating and maintaining the supportive and respectful culture we are hoping to cultivate through the idea of Panga.

## Participating in Panga
As part of cultivating a shared-context from which to connect around different forms of collective practices, the Panga Context-Setting Workshops was intended to offer a way to explore the emerging Panga idea before making an informed decision about participating further. For those keen to build on this Panga idea, we invite you to co-create a network to connect the network of people in our local areas who are experimenting with various approaches to collectively meeting daily needs such as food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety. As a starting point, we hope to cultivate the following participation pathways:
  * Recharging with cozy hopepunk conversations at the Panga Campfire 
  * Amplifying global examples of collective practices that we can learn from in our local contexts 
  * Nourishing our interdependent relationships (e.g., by hosting and/or attending Panga Gatherings) 
  * Exploring the potential of specific collectivist experiments (e.g. by participating in Panga Pods)  
  * Stewarding the Panga vision and/or building the infrastructure to support this vision (see Panga Collectives)
  * Adapting Panga-hosted tools and processes to experiment with collectivist practices (see Panga Affiliated Collectives)

## Invitation Principles 

When you would like to invite additional people to join us in any of these aspects of Panga we expect you to do so thoughtfully; when you have the capacity to support the newly joined participant in learning the shared context Panga cultivates and to take responsibility for co-creating this network of interdependent relationships through which we can experiments with multiple overlapping collectivists practices. 

The following are an initial set of Principles we hope will help guide us all in being thoughtful about when, how, and why we invite more people to participate in co-creating our network of collectivists experiments.
  * Trust & Respect
  * Building on shared foundations
  * Interdependent responsibility

These Principles are intended to reflect our 'growth at the speed of trust' goals. Together, these principles inform our invitation expectations that an existing participant can explain to another existing participant why they *trust* the potential participant to engage *respectfully* with other participants; the potential participant's interest in *building on shared foundations* to explore potential approaches to co-creating better futures by collectivising our basic needs; and the degree to which the existing participant is willing to take *responsibility* for supporting each new potential participant in navigating the *interdependent* relationships that may emerge through their participation in Panga.

## Invitation Preparation 

To help in considering the relevance of these invitation principles in specific situations, please consider how you would explain to an existing participant why it is a good idea to invite this potential participant to join //now//. For example, consider how you would finish the following statements: 
  * Interest: The aspects of Panga that are most likely to be of interest to [Name] are.... 
  * Alignment: The Panga values and theories of change I think are most likely to resonate with [Name] are....
  * Context: The existing context [Name] has for the shared foundation we are currently building-on within Panga include...  
  * Capacity: [Name's] current capacity to contribute to Panga is likely to be.... 
  * Conflict navigation: If conflict arise between [Name] and other Panga participants, I am able to support them to navigate that in the following ways... (And, if [Name] and I need to navigate a conflict we are prepared to.... )

## Invitation Process

  * Once you have considered the Invitation Principles and are confident about inviting a potential participant to the Campfire, please reach out to another existing participant to explain why this is a good time to invite this person into these conversations:
  * If this second existing participant supports the invitation, they can post an invitation request in the appropriate Campfire thread explaining why this is a good time to invite this person into these conversations
  * This post will trigger an email to be sent to the potential participant with a link to the Yam Daisy invitation process (offering some context about Panga, and a personalised invitation from you to attend an upcoming [Panga Context-Setting Workshop](participating_in_panga/panga_workshop_intro.md))
